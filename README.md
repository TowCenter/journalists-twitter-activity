The Tow Center collected approximately 4,000 journalists' Twitter handles from both local and national U.S. publications such as the NYT, CNN, Fox News and Breitbart between June 1st 2022 and January 30th 2023. The `newsroom_data/` folder contains CSV files with tweets for each publication. Twitter handles were obtained from each publicationâ€™s official Twitter page. For instance, journalists associated with Fox News can be found [here](https://twitter.com/i/lists/124314/members) and NYT journalists [here](https://twitter.com/i/lists/54340435/members). The dataset does not account for deleted tweets.
